        <h1 id="a1">California Facing Worst Drought on Record</h1>
        <p>The most populated state in the country is facing what may be its 
           worst drought in a century of record-keeping. On January 20, the 
           governor of California declared a state of emergency, urging everyone
           to begin conserving water. <a href="http://www.cnrfc.noaa.gov/water_resources_update.php">Water levels</a> in all but a few reservoirs in 
           the state are less than 50% of capacity, mountains <a href="http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/NaturalHazards/view.php?id=82910&amp;eocn=home&amp;eoci=nh">are nearly bare of 
           snow</a> except at the highest elevations, and the <a href="http://www.fire.ca.gov/">fire risk</a> is extreme.  
           In Nevada, the situation is much the same.</p>

        <p>California has a climate like the Mediterranean region: hot, dry summers
           and mild, wet winters. More than half of the annual precipitation arrives
           via winter storms between December and February. For the third winter in a 
           row, precipitation has been below normal across the state. The last week of
           January is the midway point of the winter wet season, and accumulated 
           precipitation since July is the lowest on record.</p>

        <p>The current conditions are the product of several poor wet seasons in
           succession. The past 30 months—encompassing the past two winter wet seasons 
           and the first half of the current one—are the driest since 1895 for
           comparable months.</p>

        <p>On average, California will accumulate more than 53 inches of precipitation
           statewide over a typical 30-month span stretching from July to December, based
           on NOAA Climate Division Data. (Of course, there are huge differences from place
           to place based on elevation.) In the 30 months preceding December 2013, the 
           state has received closer to 33 inches, just a bit less than the previous record
           low for a similar period, from July 1975-December 1977.</p>

        <h1 id="a2">January precipitation deficits keep California drought outlook grim</h1>
        <p>
            In our first post on the drought emergency in California and Nevada, we talked about 
            conditions on a statewide level over the past two and half years. But a statewide 
            average over a relatively long period can hide important variation from place to place, 
            especially in a mountainous state like California, where the high elevations can get 
            several times more average annual precipitation than adjacent valleys do.
        </p>

        <p>
            The map above shows the relative dryness from place to place, revealing that the 30-month
            precipitation deficits ending in December 2013 were more severe in southern California 
            than northern California, and generally appear to be more severe in the mountains than in
            lower elevations.  The accentuation of deficits over higher elevations is particularly
            meaningful, because it is in mountain catchments where much of California’s water resources
            are generated.
        </p>

        <p>
            A little more than half the state’s precipitation typically arrives via winter storms in 
            December through February. Observations collected during January indicate that no relief
            occurred; in fact the extreme lack of precipitation during October through December 2013
            has intensified the deficit that had developed during the previous two water years. 
            Throughout the area, ranchers with no pasture for their cattle are being forced to sell;
            wells are going dry, and wildfire responders are confronting small blazes in forests that
            are usually deep in snow this time of year.

                based on preliminary <a href="http://www.prism.oregonstate.edu/">PRISM data</a>. Most of California, southern Nevada, Arizona,
                New Mexico, and Texas received 25% or less of their normal precipitation.

        </figure>
        <p>
            Unfortunately, NOAA climate scientists couldn’t give Californians any good news when they
            issued their monthly U.S. drought outlook on January 31, 2014. Drought is likely to continue
            or worsen through February across virtually all of California and the rest of the West Coast.
            Drought is likely to envelop the portion of the state that was not already in drought—a small
            sliver in the extreme southeast where California meets Nevada and Arizona.
